# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QA Operator is an intelligent Python agent that automates end-to-end testing workflows using Playwright. It can draft tests, execute them, analyze failures, and automatically patch code issues. The system integrates with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to interact with browsers, filesystems, and optionally Git repositories. It uses a dual-model approach with OpenAI for planning/debugging and local Ollama (Qwen3) for cost-effective drafting operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated agent that can create Playwright tests from specifications, so that I can maintain comprehensive test coverage without manual test writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test specification is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a complete Playwright TypeScript test file in the e2e/ directory
2. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL use semantic selectors (getByRole, getByLabel, getByTestId) and avoid brittle CSS selectors
3. WHEN creating test files THEN the system SHALL follow the established project structure and naming conventions
4. IF no test exists for a feature THEN the system SHALL scaffold a new spec file with appropriate page object patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the agent to execute tests and capture comprehensive failure diagnostics, so that I can quickly understand and resolve test issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run them using Playwright MCP tools
2. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL automatically capture traces, screenshots, console logs, and network activity
3. WHEN the CI environment variable is set to true THEN the system SHALL execute tests in headless mode for performance
4. WHEN the CI environment variable is not set or false THEN the system SHALL execute tests in headed mode for visibility
5. WHEN a command-line flag --headless is provided THEN the system SHALL override environment detection and run in headless mode
5. WHEN test execution completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive run report

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to automatically diagnose test failures and propose fixes, so that I can resolve flaky or broken tests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL analyze stack traces, page snapshots, and logs to identify root causes
2. WHEN failure analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL propose minimal code patches to fix identified issues
3. WHEN proposing patches THEN the system SHALL focus on selector improvements and wait condition adjustments
4. WHEN flaky tests are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest stability improvements like assertion-based waits and locator filtering
5. WHEN patches are applied THEN the system SHALL re-run tests to verify fixes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to integrate with MCP servers safely, so that it can perform file operations and browser automation without compromising system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts THEN it SHALL register with configured MCP servers (Playwright and Filesystem)
2. WHEN performing file operations THEN the system SHALL restrict access to the e2e/ directory only
3. WHEN using Playwright MCP THEN the system SHALL have access to browser navigation, interaction, and diagnostic tools
4. WHEN MCP servers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry connections with exponential backoff before failing
5. WHEN MCP connection retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want the agent to use different AI models for different tasks, so that I can optimize performance and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing planning and debugging tasks THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI models for high-quality reasoning
2. WHEN drafting initial test code THEN the system SHALL use local Ollama (Qwen3) for cost-effective generation
3. WHEN model routing is configured THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch between models based on task type
4. WHEN local models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to OpenAI models with appropriate logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to follow testing best practices, so that the generated tests are maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating selectors THEN the system SHALL prefer getByRole, getByLabel, and getByTestId over CSS selectors
2. WHEN adding waits THEN the system SHALL use expect(locator).toBeVisible() instead of arbitrary timeouts
3. WHEN brittle selectors are necessary THEN the system SHALL include justifying comments
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL limit to one targeted retry before marking as flaky
5. WHEN creating page objects THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for maintainability
6. WHEN generating test code THEN the system SHALL run a post-generation selector audit to ensure compliance with selector policies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a CI/CD engineer, I want the agent to integrate with version control systems, so that test fixes and reports can be automatically committed and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git MCP is configured THEN the system SHALL be able to stage and commit test changes
2. WHEN test patches are created THEN the system SHALL optionally create pull requests with detailed reports
3. WHEN operating in CI mode THEN the system SHALL attach failure artifacts to build reports
4. WHEN Git operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require manual approval for safety

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and observability from the agent, so that I can monitor its performance and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent performs any operation THEN it SHALL emit structured logs with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed tracing information for all MCP calls and model interactions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log complete context including stack traces, model responses, and MCP server states
4. WHEN the agent completes a workflow THEN it SHALL log performance metrics including execution time and model usage
5. WHEN operating in production THEN the system SHALL support configurable log levels and output formats

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to maintain test suite health, so that tests remain stable and valuable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test patterns THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest removal of duplicate helpers
2. WHEN detecting unstable selectors THEN the system SHALL automatically propose more robust alternatives
3. WHEN tests require data setup THEN the system SHALL suggest deterministic seeding approaches
4. WHEN test maintenance is needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for suite optimization
